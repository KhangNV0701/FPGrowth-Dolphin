Hello everyone!
This is a project made by me - KhangNV0701 and my friend - locnd-172. We've done this project for a while, and decided to push it to github. 
In this project, we implemented FPGrowth algorithm to mine all frequent pattern patterns in data sets, then compared the result with WEKA. The correctness of our project, compared to WEKA, achieved with 85%.
